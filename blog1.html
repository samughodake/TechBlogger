                </h2>
                <p class="lead"><b>Writing code</b> can sometimes be the most difficult part of any software development
                    process. If you don’t organize everything from the start – especially for big projects — the coding
                    processes and code management afterwards may end up not just time consuming, but also a big
                    headache.
                    <br>
                    Good code is maintainable, reusable, and testable. The following tips address how you and/or your
                    development team can handle various coding tasks and how to keep everything as neat as possible. I
                    will introduce you to some “best practices” that will help you write better code and help make you
                    and your team happy and efficient.
                    <br>
                <h3>1. Use a Coding Standard</h3>
                <p class="lead"> It’s easy to write bad, unorganized code, but it’s hard to maintain such code. Good
                    code typically follows some standard for naming conventions, formatting, etc. Such standards are
                    nice because they make things deterministic to those who read your code afterwards, including
                    yourself.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead"> You can create your own coding standard, but it’s better to stick to one with
                    wider-acceptance. Publicly maintained standards like Zend Framework Coding Standard or soon to be
                    PSR-1 Coding Style Guide instead, it will be easier for others to adapt.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Write Useful Comments</h3>
                <p class="lead">Comments are crucial. You won’t appreciate them until you leave your thousand-line
                    script for a couple of days and return to and try and make sense of it. Useful comments make life
                    easier for yourself and those after you who have to maintain your code.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">Write meaningful, single line comments for vague lines; write full parameter and
                    functionality descriptions for functions and methods; for tricky logic blocks, describe the logic in
                    words before it if necessary. And don’t forget, always keep your comments up to date!</p>
                <br>
                <h3>3. Refactor</h3>
                <p class="lead"> Code refactoring is the eighth habit of highly effective developers. Believe it or not,
                    you should be refactoring your code on a daily bases or your code is not in good health! Refactoring
                    keeps your code healthy, but what should you refactor and how?</p>

                <br>
                <p class="lead"> If your function or method is more than 20-25 lines, it’s more likely that you are
                    including too much logic inside it, and you can probably split it into two or more smaller
                    functions/methods.
                    If your method/function name is more than 20 characters, you should either rethink the name, or
                    rethink the whole function/method by reviewing the first rule.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">If you have a lot of nested loops then you may be doing some resource-intensive
                    processing without realizing it. In general, you should rethink the logic if you are nesting more
                    than 2 loops. Three nested loops is just horrible!
                    Consider if there are any applicable design patterns your code can follow. You shouldn’t use
                    patterns just for the sake of using patterns, but patterns offer tried-and-true ready-thought
                    solutions that could be applicable.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>4. Avoid Global Code</h3>
                <p class="lead"> Global variables and loops are a mess and can prove problematic when your application
                    grows to millions of lines of code (which most do!). They may influence code elsewhere that is
                    difficult to discern, or cause noisy naming clashes. Think twice before you pollute the global
                    namespace with variables, functions, loops, etc.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">In an ideal case, you should have no blocks defined globally. That is. all switch
                    statements, try-catch, foreach, while-loops, etc. should be written inside a method or a function.
                    Methods should be written inside class definitions, and class and function definitions should be
                    within namespaces.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>5. Use Meaningful Names</h3>
                <p class="lead">Never use names like $k, $m, and $test for your variables. How do expect to read such
                    code in the future? Good code should be meaningful in terms of variable names, function/method
                    names, and class names. Some good examples of meaningful names are: $request, $dbResult, and
                    $tempFile (depending on your coding style guidelines these may use underscores, camelCase, or
                    PascalCase).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>6. Use Meaningful Structures</h3>
                <p class="lead"> Structuring your application is very important; don’t use complicated structures,
                    always stick to simplicity. When naming directories and files, use a naming convention you agree
                    upon with your team, or use one associated with your coding standard. Always split the four parts of
                    any typical PHP application apart from each other – CSS, HTML Templates/Layouts, JavaScript, PHP
                    Code – and for each try to split libraries from business logic. It’s also a good idea to keep your
                    directory hierarchy as shallow as possible so it’s easier to navigate and find the code you’re
                    looking for.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>7. Use Version Control Software</h3>
                <p class="lead">In the old days, good development teams relied on CVS and diff patches for version
                    control. Nowadays, though, we have a variety of solutions available. Managing changes and revisions
                    should be easy but effective, so pick whatever version control software that will work best with the
                    workflow of your development team. I prefer using a distributed version control tool like Git or
                    Mercurial; both are free software/open source and very powerful.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>8. Use Automated Build Tools</h3>
                <p class="lead"> Try to use tools like Ant or Phing to get your source prepared, compressed, and
                    deployed. Building your whole application with a single command is a marvelous way to prevent errors
                    and omissions that are inherent when performing repetitive tasks, and is a generally core
                    pre-requisite for automated testing strategies. I recommend using Phing, it’s a well-supported build
                    tool for PHP written to mimic Ant; if you aren’t familiar with it, check out Shammer C’s article
                    Using Phing, the PHP Build Tool and Vito Tardia’s article Deploy and Release Your Application with
                    Phing.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>9. Use Code Documenters</h3>
                <p class="lead"> For large applications spanning several classes and namespaces, you should have
                    automatically generated API documentation. This is very useful and keeps the development team aware
                    of “what’s what.” And if you work on several projects at the same time, you will find such
                    documentation a blessing since you may forget about structures switching back and forth between
                    projects. One such documenter you might consider using is DocBlox.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>10. Use a Testing Framework</h3>
                <p class="lead"> There are a plenty of tools that I really appreciate, but by far the ones I appreciate
                    the most are the frameworks that help automate the testing process. Testing (particularly systematic
                    testing) is crucial to every piece of your million dollar application. Good testing tools are
                    PHPUnit and SimpleTest for unit testing your PHP Classes. For GUI testing, I recommend SeleniumHQ
                    tools.</p>
